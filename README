CS-2362 Computer Security And Privacy
Pset3 Problem 1-9 (RSA)

This RSA implementation consists of 4 python files-
(1) keygen.py - For generating a public and private key-pair
(2) encrypt.py - For encrypting plaintext using public key
(3) decrypt.py - For decrypting ciphertext (encrypted with public key) using private key
(4) helper.py - Custom helper file with required functions such as prime generation and modular exponentiation

One can run this by using the driver code present in the file r"un.py"
In your terminal, simply enter -
	python run.py

This uses the above mentioned files to generate a keypair, encrypt some standard plaintext file, and decrypts it. Expect 4 output files - public_key.txt, private_key.txt, ciphertext.txt, and deciphertext.txt (identical to plaintext.txt)

Alternatively, you can run each file separately as -
	python <filename>

No command line arguments/dependencies are required

Output Format - 
	1) public_key.txt
		Line 1: e
		Line 2: n
	2) private_key.txt
		Line 1: d
